The **Korblab** is based at the Department of Psychology, University of Essex, UK.

We are investigating the production and perception of emotional expressions, especially in the face, from an embodied cognition point of view. We are particulartly interested  in understanding how proprioceptive information about our own body contributes to the processing, recognition, and awareness of emotions in others. 

We use different techniques, such as electromyography (EMG), electroencephalography (EEG), and facial neuromuscular electrical stimulation (fNMES).
  
Other topics of interest include (social and musical) rewards, emotion regulation, joint attention, and empathy.
