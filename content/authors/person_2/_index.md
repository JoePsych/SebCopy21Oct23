Themis Efthimiou is a final-year PhD student at the University of Essex, working under the supervision of Dr. Sebastian Korb. Themis is currently working to develop the technique of facial Neuromuscular Electrical Stimulation. The goal of this project is to provide the research community with safety guidelines for implementing this technique, as well as to demonstrate its use in the investigation of proprioceptive feedback on oneâ€™s emotional experience and recognition of affective stimuli.
