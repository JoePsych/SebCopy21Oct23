I completed my undergraduate degree in Psychology at Nottingham Trent University and my masters degree in Cognitive Neuroscience and Neuroimaging at the University of Nottingham. Whilst managing an EEG laboratory for 7 years I also completed my PhD in which I investigated how cognitive processes interact and influence how we control our bodies, and how body movements can influence the processing of information. Following my PhD I relocated to Hamburg to the Institute of Systems Neuroscience at the University Hospital Hamburg-Eppendorf for my first postdoc position. Here I used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to investigate placebo mechanisms in emotional processing. I am now working as a postdoc with Dr Sebastian Korb at the University of Essex on a project investigating how the stimulation of facial muscles can influence our mood and how we perceive the emotional world.
