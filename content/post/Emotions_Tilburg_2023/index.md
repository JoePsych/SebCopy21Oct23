The Korblab attended the Emotions conference. Sebastian Korb chaired the symposium "The Role of Sensorimotor Integration in The Experience and Perception of Affect", which included presentations by Joshua Baker and Themis Efthimiou on fNMES, as well as by Tanja Wingenbach and Michal Olszanowski on facial EMG studies.

The symposium and overall conference were a blast, stimulated our neurons, helped us meet lovely and interesting people, and inspired us to pursue new research avenues. Tilburg is a nice city, the campus is in the midst of a beautiful forest, and we even checked out Rotterdam for a few hours on the way back. A great thank you to the organisers, and looking forward to the next edition!
