 abstract = {Facial electromyography (EMG) allows to detect and quantify overt as well as subtle covert contractions of striatal facial muscles. Subjective and partly implicit affective experiences, such as the hedonic pleasure felt when consuming an exquisite meal, can thus be revealed and objectively quantified. Further, facial EMG is a convenient tool for translational research, as it can be combined with other research techniques, and therefore help to unravel brain mechanisms underlying the processing of different types of rewards. In this chapter we aim to provide step-by-step guidelines for the acquisition of facial EMG in food research in humans, using noninvasive surface electrodes. Implementations of facial EMG in behavioral settings and in combination with functional magnetic resonance imaging are discussed.},
