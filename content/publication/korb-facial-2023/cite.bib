 abstract = {According to theories of embodied cognition, facial mimicry — the spontaneous, low-intensity imitation of a perceived emotional facial expression — is first an automatic motor response, whose accompanying proprioceptive feedback contributes to emotion recognition. Alternative theoretical accounts, however, view facial mimicry as an emotional response to a rewarding stimulus, and/or an affiliative signal, and thus reject the view of an automatic motor copy.},
