abstract: According to theories of embodied cognition, facial mimicry — the spontaneous,
  low-intensity imitation of a perceived emotional facial expression — is first an
  automatic motor response, whose accompanying proprioceptive feedback contributes
  to emotion recognition. Alternative theoretical accounts, however, view facial mimicry
  as an emotional response to a rewarding stimulus, and/or an affiliative signal,
  and thus reject the view of an automatic motor copy.
