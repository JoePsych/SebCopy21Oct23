abstract: Facial mimicry and emotion recognition are two socio-cognitive abilities
  involved in adaptive socio-emotional behavior, promoting affiliation and the establishment
  of social bonds. The mu-opioid receptor (MOR) system plays a key role in affiliation
  and social bonding. However, it remains unclear whether MORs are involved in the
  categorization and spontaneous mimicry of emotional facial expressions. Using a
  randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, between-subjects design, we investigated
  in 82 healthy female volunteers the effects of the specific MOR agonist morphine
  on the recognition accuracy of emotional faces (happiness, anger, fear), and on
  their facial mimicry (measured with electromyography). Frequentist statistics did
  not reveal any significant effects of drug administration on facial mimicry or emotion
  recognition abilities. However, post hoc Bayesian analyses provided support for
  an effect of morphine on facial mimicry of fearful facial expressions. Specifically,
  compared to placebo, morphine reduced mimicry of fear, as shown by lower activity
  of the frontalis muscle. Bayesian analyses also provided support for the absence
  of a drug effect on mimicry of happy and angry facial expressions, which were assessed
  with the zygomaticus major and corrugator supercilii muscles, as well as on emotion
  recognition accuracy. These findings suggest that MOR activity is involved in automatic
  facial responses to fearful stimuli, but not in their identification. Overall, the
  current results, together with the previously reported small effects of opioid compounds,
  suggest a relatively marginal role of the MOR system in emotion simulation and perception.
