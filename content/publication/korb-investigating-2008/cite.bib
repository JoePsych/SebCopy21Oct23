 abstract = {Facial expressions are part of emotional reactions. However, humans can voluntarily pose a specific emotional expression without having the corresponding underlying feeling, or voluntarily modify (e.g. reduce or enhance) their spontaneous expression in reaction to an emotional event. Few studies have attempted to distinguish these different processes at the level of the central nervous system (CNS), even though spontaneous and voluntary facial expressions are long thought to rely upon distinct neural circuitries. Here, we review the neural bases of spontaneous and voluntary facial expressions, report the results of a first study assessing the Bereitschaftspotential (BP) before voluntary smiles, and outline a combined EEG/EMG approach for investigating facial expressions at the level of the CNS.},
