abstract: Facial expressions are part of emotional reactions. However, humans can
  voluntarily pose a specific emotional expression without having the corresponding
  underlying feeling, or voluntarily modify (e.g. reduce or enhance) their spontaneous
  expression in reaction to an emotional event. Few studies have attempted to distinguish
  these different processes at the level of the central nervous system (CNS), even
  though spontaneous and voluntary facial expressions are long thought to rely upon
  distinct neural circuitries. Here, we review the neural bases of spontaneous and
  voluntary facial expressions, report the results of a first study assessing the
  Bereitschaftspotential (BP) before voluntary smiles, and outline a combined EEG/EMG
  approach for investigating facial expressions at the level of the CNS.
