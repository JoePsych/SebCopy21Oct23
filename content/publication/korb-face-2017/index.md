abstract: An important question in neuroscience is which multisensory information,
  presented outside of awareness, can influence the nature and speed of conscious
  access to our percepts. Recently, proprioceptive feedback of the hand was reported
  to lead to faster awareness of congruent hand images in a breaking continuous flash
  suppression (b-CFS) paradigm. Moreover, a vast literature suggests that spontaneous
  facial mimicry can improve emotion recognition, even without awareness of the stimulus
  face. However, integration of visual and proprioceptive information about the face
  to date has not been tested with CFS. The modulation of visual awareness of emotional
  faces by facial proprioception was investigated across three separate experiments.
  Face proprioception was induced with voluntary facial expressions or with spontaneous
  facial mimicry. Frequentist statistical analyses were complemented with Bayesian
  statistics. No evidence of multisensory integration was found, suggesting that proprioception
  does not modulate access to visual awareness of emotional faces in a CFS paradigm.
