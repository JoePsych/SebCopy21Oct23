abstract: Under theories of embodied emotion, exposure to a facial expression triggers
  facial mimicry. Facial feedback is then used to recognize and judge the perceived
  expression. However, the neural bases of facial mimicry and of the use of facial
  feedback remain poorly understood. Furthermore, gender differences in facial mimicry
  and emotion recognition suggest that different neural substrates might accompany
  the production of facial mimicry, and the processing of facial feedback, in men
  and women. Here, repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) was applied
  to the right primary motor cortex (M1), the right primary somatosensory cortex (S1),
  or, in a control condition, the vertex (VTX). Facial mimicry of smiles and emotion
  judgments were recorded in response to video clips depicting changes from neutral
  or angry to happy facial expressions. While in females rTMS over M1 and S1 compared
  to VTX led to reduced mimicry and, in the case of M1, delayed detection of smiles,
  there was no effect of TMS condition for males. We conclude that in female participants
  M1 and S1 play a role in the mimicry and in the use of facial feedback for accurate
  processing of smiles.
