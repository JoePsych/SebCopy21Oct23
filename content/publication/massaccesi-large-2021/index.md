abstract: In most European countries, the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic (spring
  2020) led to the imposition of physical distancing rules, resulting in a drastic
  and sudden reduction of real-life social interactions. Even people not directly
  affected by the virus itself were impacted in their physical and/or mental health,
  as well as in their financial security, by governmental lockdown measures. We investigated
  if the combination of these events had changed people’s appraisal of social scenes
  by testing 241 participants recruited mainly in Italy, Austria, and Germany in an
  online, pre-registered study conducted about 50 days after the beginning of the
  COVID-19 outbreak in Europe. Images depicting individuals alone, in small groups
  (up to four people) and in large groups (more than seven people) were rated in terms
  of valence, arousal, and perceived physical distance. Pre-pandemic normative ratings
  were obtained from a validated database (Kurdi et al., 2017). Several self-report
  measures were also taken, and condensed into four factors through factor analysis.
  All images were rated as more arousing compared to the pre-pandemic period, and
  the greater the decrease in real-life physical interactions reported by participants,
  the higher the ratings of arousal. As expected, only images depicting large gatherings
  of people were rated less positively during, compared to before, the pandemic. These
  ratings of valence were however moderated by a factor that included participants’
  number of days in isolation, relationship closeness, and perceived COVID-19 threat.
  Higher scores on this factor were associated with more positive ratings of images
  of individuals alone and in small groups, suggesting an increased appreciation of
  safer social situations, such as intimate and small-group contacts. The same factor
  was inversely related to the perceived physical distance between individuals in
  images of small and large groups, suggesting an impact of lockdown measures and
  contagion-related worries on the representation of interpersonal space. These findings
  point to rapid and compelling psychological and social consequences of the lockdown
  measures imposed during the COVID-19 pandemic on the perception of social groups.
  Further studies should assess the long-term impact of such events as typical everyday
  life is restored.
