abstract: The neurophysiological study of emotion regulation focused on the strategy
  of reappraisal—i.e., the cognitive reinterpretation of a stimulus. Reappraisal reduces
  emotional expression, the experience of both negative and positive feelings, and
  the amplitude of an event-related potential (ERP)—the late positive potential (LPP).
  In contrast, the strategy of expressive suppression (ES), being the inhibition of
  emotional expression, has been reported to reduce subjective feelings of positive,
  but not negative emotion, and has not yet been investigated with ERPs. We focused
  on the LPP to assess the correlates of ES in the context of humor perception. Twenty-two
  female participants rated sequences of humorous (H) and non-humorous (NH) pictures,
  while their zygomaticus muscle was recorded. A spontaneous (SP) condition, in which
  participants attended naturally to the pictures, resulted in higher ratings of funniness,
  increased smiling, and increased LPP amplitude for H compared to NH stimuli. An
  ES condition, in which participants suppressed their facial reactions, resulted
  in reduced smiling, without affecting subjective ratings. LPP amplitude did not
  differ between H and NH stimuli during ES, suggesting equal allocation of processing
  resources to both stimuli. These results suggest that, similarly to reappraisal,
  ES modifies the way the brain processes positive emotional stimuli.
