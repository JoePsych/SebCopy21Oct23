abstract: Exposure to body odors (chemosignals) collected under different emotional
  states (i.e., emotional chemosignals) can modulate our visual system, biasing visual
  perception. Recent research has suggested that exposure to fear body odors, results
  in a generalized faster access to visual awareness of different emotional facial
  expressions (i.e., fear, happy, and neutral). In the present study, we aimed at
  replicating and extending these findings by exploring if these effects are limited
  to fear odor, by introducing a second negative body odorâ€”that is, disgust. We compared
  the time that 3 different emotional facial expressions (i.e., fear, disgust, and
  neutral) took to reach visual awareness, during a breaking continuous flash suppression
  paradigm, across 3 body odor conditions (i.e., fear, disgust, and neutral). We found
  that fear body odors do not trigger an overall faster access to visual awareness,
  but instead sped-up access to awareness specifically for facial expressions of fear.
  Disgust odor, on the other hand, had no effects on awareness thresholds of facial
  expressions. These findings contrast with prior results, suggesting that the potential
  of fear body odors to induce visual processing adjustments is specific to fear cues.
  Furthermore, our results support a unique ability of fear body odors in inducing
  such visual processing changes, compared with other negative emotional chemosignals
  (i.e., disgust). These conclusions raise interesting questions as to how fear odor
  might interact with the visual processing stream, whilst simultaneously giving rise
  to future avenues of research.
