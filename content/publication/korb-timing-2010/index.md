abstract: Results obtained with a novel emotional Go/NoGo task allowing the investigation
  of facial mimicry (FM) during the production and inhibition of voluntary smiles
  are discussed. Healthy participants were asked to smile rapidly to happy faces and
  maintain a neutral expression to neutral faces, or the reverse. Replicating and
  extending previous results, happy faces induced FM, as shown by stronger and faster
  zygomatic activation to happy than neutral faces in Go trials, and a greater number
  of false alarms to happy faces in NoGo trials. Facial mimicry effects remained present
  during participants' active inhibition of facial movement. Latencies of FM were
  short with 126-250 ms in Go trials, and 251-375 ms in NoGo trials. The utility of
  the Go/NoGo task, which allows the assessment of response inhibition in the domain
  of facial expression by installing strong prepotent motor responses via short stimulus
  presentation times and a great number of Go trials, is discussed.
