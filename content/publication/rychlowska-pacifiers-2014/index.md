abstract: "Research shows that pacifiers disrupt infants' mimicry of facial expressions.\
  \ This experiment examines whether pacifiers interfere with caretakers' ability\
  \ to mimic infants' emotions. Adults saw photographs of infants with or without\
  \ a pacifier. When infants had pacifiers, perceivers showed reduced EMG activity\
  \ to infants' smiles. Smiles of infants using a pacifier were also rated as less\
  \ happy than smiles depicted without a pacifier. The same pattern was observed for\
  \ expressions of distress: adults rated infants presented with pacifiers as less\
  \ sad than infants without pacifiers. We discuss deleterious effects of pacifier\
  \ use for the perceiver's resonance with a child's emotions."
