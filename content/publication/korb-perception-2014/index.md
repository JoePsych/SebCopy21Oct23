abstract: The mechanisms through which people perceive different types of smiles and
  judge their authenticity remain unclear. Here, 19 different types of smiles were
  created based on the Facial Action Coding System (FACS), using highly controlled,
  dynamic avatar faces. Participants observed short videos of smiles while their facial
  mimicry was measured with electromyography (EMG) over four facial muscles. Smile
  authenticity was judged after each trial. Avatar attractiveness was judged once
  in response to each avatar’s neutral face. Results suggest that, in contrast to
  most earlier work using static pictures as stimuli, participants relied less on
  the Duchenne marker (the presence of crow’s feet wrinkles around the eyes) in their
  judgments of authenticity. Furthermore, mimicry of smiles occurred in the Zygomaticus
  Major, Orbicularis Oculi, and Corrugator muscles. Consistent with theories of embodied
  cognition, activity in these muscles predicted authenticity judgments, suggesting
  that facial mimicry influences the perception of smiles. However, no significant
  mediation effect of facial mimicry was found. Avatar attractiveness did not predict
  authenticity judgments or mimicry patterns.
