abstract: Schizotypy is a personality structure that resembles positive, negative,
  and disorganized symptoms of schizophrenia, often associated with abnormal emotional
  face perception. Moreover, due to the predominant sense characterizing psychotic
  experiences, people with high schizotypal traits might be more prone to anticipate
  a potential threat based on the immediate perceptual history of othersâ€™ facial expressions.
  To test this hypothesis, angry-to-ambiguous and happy-to-ambiguous dynamic avatar
  faces were presented, each followed by a probe depicting the same expression as
  the final frame of the dynamic face (ambiguous) or one slightly changed to greater
  happiness/anger. Participants were asked to judge if the probe was equal to the
  final frame and to rate how confident they were. The direction of bias was calculated,
  with positive values indicating a Representational Momentum (RM) effect, a perceptual
  phenomenon in which the offset of a dynamic event is systematically displaced forward,
  into the immediate future. Firstly, happy-to-ambiguous faces significantly induced
  RM, suggesting an emotional anticipation for dynamic faces changing towards a potential
  threat. Secondly, this effect was higher for male than female faces, consistent
  with a maleness-anger association. Thirdly, and more importantly, our hypothesis
  of higher RM for happy-to-ambiguous faces in people with high (compared to low)
  schizotypal traits was not confirmed, as no effect of schizotypal traits was observed.
  This suggests a typical pattern of emotional anticipation for dynamic emotional
  faces in subclinical schizotypy. Future studies should investigate if the same holds
  for clinical manifestations of schizophrenia.
