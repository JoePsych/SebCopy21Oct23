abstract: Human behaviour requires flexible arbitration between actions we do out
  of habit and actions that are directed towards a specific goal. Drugs that target
  opioid and dopamine receptors are notorious for inducing maladaptive habitual drug
  consumption; yet, how the opioidergic and dopaminergic neurotransmitter systems
  contribute to the arbitration between habitual and goal-directed behaviour is poorly
  understood. By combining pharmacological challenges with a well-established decision-making
  task and a novel computational model, we show that the administration of the dopamine
  D2/3 receptor antagonist amisulpride led to an increase in goal-directed or ‘model-based’
  relative to habitual or ‘model-free’ behaviour, whereas the non-selective opioid
  receptor antagonist naltrexone had no appreciable effect. The effect of amisulpride
  on model-based/model-free behaviour did not scale with drug serum levels in the
  blood. Furthermore, participants with higher amisulpride serum levels showed higher
  explorative behaviour. These findings highlight the distinct functional contributions
  of dopamine and opioid receptors to goal-directed and habitual behaviour and support
  the notion that even small doses of amisulpride promote flexible application of
  cognitive control.
