abstract: Joint attention (JA) and spontaneous facial mimicry (SFM) are fundamental
  processes in social interactions, and they are closely related to empathic abilities.
  When tested independently, both of these processes have been usually observed to
  be atypical in individuals with autism spectrum conditions (ASC). However, it is
  not known how these processes interact with each other in relation to autistic traits.
  This study addresses this question by testing the impact of JA on SFM of happy faces
  using a truly interactive paradigm. Sixty-two neurotypical participants engaged
  in gaze-based social interaction with an anthropomorphic, gaze-contingent virtual
  agent. The agent either established JA by initiating eye contact or looked away,
  before looking at an object and expressing happiness or disgust. Eye tracking was
  used to make the agent's gaze behavior and facial actions contingent to the participants'
  gaze. SFM of happy expressions was measured by Electromyography (EMG) recording
  over the Zygomaticus Major muscle. Results showed that JA augments SFM in individuals
  with low compared with high autistic traits. These findings are in line with reports
  of reduced impact of JA on action imitation in individuals with ASC. Moreover, they
  suggest that investigating atypical interactions between empathic processes, instead
  of testing these processes individually, might be crucial to understanding the nature
  of social deficits in autism.
