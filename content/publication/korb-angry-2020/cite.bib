 abstract = {Judgments about the emotional expression of a face are influenced by its sexual features, and vice versa. The cause of this interaction remains unclear. Most previous research has used standard analyses of categorisation responses to full-blown emotional expressions. A better understanding of the phenomenon may however require the adoption of nuanced stimuli and sophisticated analyses methods. For example, Harris et al. (2016), used psychophysics methods to compare responses to faces displaying emotions at several intensity levels. The point of subjective equality (PSE), at which happy and angry categories are equally likely, was found to be closer to the happiness pole for male compared to female faces. Because these methods seem promising for the quest of advancing the field to a better understanding of how emotional and social judgments of faces are formed, we attempted a replication of Harris et al.’s study, after pre-registration in an independent public registry (https://bit.ly/2v8BW7Q). A large sample (N = 108) from a comparable population was tested with the same stimuli and task as in the original publication. We successfully replicated the main and some secondary findings, which we discuss in the context of the literature, and we indicate promising avenues of research in this domain.},
