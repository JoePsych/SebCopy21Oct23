abstract: Judgments about the emotional expression of a face are influenced by its
  sexual features, and vice versa. The cause of this interaction remains unclear.
  Most previous research has used standard analyses of categorisation responses to
  full-blown emotional expressions. A better understanding of the phenomenon may however
  require the adoption of nuanced stimuli and sophisticated analyses methods. For
  example, Harris et al. (2016), used psychophysics methods to compare responses to
  faces displaying emotions at several intensity levels. The point of subjective equality
  (PSE), at which happy and angry categories are equally likely, was found to be closer
  to the happiness pole for male compared to female faces. Because these methods seem
  promising for the quest of advancing the field to a better understanding of how
  emotional and social judgments of faces are formed, we attempted a replication of
  Harris et al.’s study, after pre-registration in an independent public registry
  (https://bit.ly/2v8BW7Q). A large sample (N = 108) from a comparable population
  was tested with the same stimuli and task as in the original publication. We successfully
  replicated the main and some secondary findings, which we discuss in the context
  of the literature, and we indicate promising avenues of research in this domain.
