abstract: Spontaneous facial mimicry is modulated by many factors, and often needs
  to be suppressed to comply with social norms. The neural basis for the inhibition
  of facial mimicry was investigated in a combined functional magnetic resonance imaging
  (fMRI) and electromyography (EMG) study in 39 healthy participants. In an operant
  conditioning paradigm, face identities were associated with reward or punishment
  and were later shown expressing dynamic smiles and anger expressions. Face identities
  previously associated with punishment, compared to reward, were disliked by participants
  overall, and their smiles generated less mimicry. Consistent with previous research
  on the inhibition of finger/hand movements, the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC)
  was activated when previous conditioning was incongruent with the valence of the
  expression. On such trials there was also greater functional connectivity of the
  mPFC with insula and premotor cortex as tested with psychophysiological interaction
  (PPI), suggesting inhibition of areas associated with the production of facial mimicry
  and the processing of facial feedback. The findings suggest that the mPFC supports
  the inhibition of facial mimicry, and support the claim of theories of embodied
  cognition that facial mimicry constitutes a spontaneous low-level motor imitation.
