abstract: The neuropeptide oxytocin (OT) has many potential social benefits. For example,
  intranasal administration of OT appears to trigger caregiving behavior and to improve
  the recognition of emotional facial expressions. But the mechanism for these effects
  is not yet clear. Recent findings relating OT to action imitation and to the visual
  processing of the eye region of faces point to mimicry as a mechanism through which
  OT improves processing of emotional expression. To test the hypothesis that increased
  levels of OT in the brain enhance facial mimicry, 60 healthy male participants were
  administered, in a double-blind between-subjects design, 24 international units
  (IUs) of OT or placebo (PLA) through nasal spray. Facial mimicry and emotion judgments
  were recorded in response to movie clips depicting changing facial expressions.
  As expected, facial mimicry was increased in the OT group, but effects were strongest
  for angry infant faces. These findings provide further evidence for the importance
  of OT in social cognitive skills, and suggest that facial mimicry mediates the effects
  of OT on improved emotion recognition.
