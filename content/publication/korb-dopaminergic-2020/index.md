abstract: textlessptextgreaterThe observation of animal hedonic orofacial and behavioral
  reactions has played a fundamental role for the identification of a dopaminergic
  motivational, and an opioidergic hedonic component of reward. Translation to humans
  remains difficult, however, as human research has struggled to adopt a similar operationalization
  of reward. Here, we investigated the neurochemical basis of hedonic facial and behavioral
  reactions to different types of rewards in healthy adult volunteers, by pharmacologically
  reducing dopaminergic and opiodergic receptor-specific action. Subjective ratings,
  physical effort, and facial reactions to matched primary social (affective touch)
  and nonsocial (food) rewards were assessed. Both drugs resulted in reduced physical
  effort and increased negative facial reactions during reward anticipation, but only
  opioidergic manipulation caused reduced positive facial reactions during reward
  consumption. This suggest that facial reactions during anticipated and experienced
  pleasure rely on partly different neurochemical systems, providing novel evidence
  in support of existing theoretical models of reward.textless/ptextgreater
