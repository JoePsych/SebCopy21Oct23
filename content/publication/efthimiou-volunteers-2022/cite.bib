 abstract = {Facial neuromuscular electrical stimulation (NMES) is the application of an electrical current to the skin to induce muscle contractions and has enormous potential for basic research and clinical intervention in psychology and neuroscience. Because the technique remains largely unknown, and the prospect of receiving electricity to the face can be daunting, willingness to receive facial NMES is likely to be low and gender differences might exist in the amount of concern for the sensation of pain and skin burns. We investigated these questions in 182 healthy participants. The likelihood of taking part (LOTP) in a hypothetical facial NMES study was measured both before and after presenting a detailed vignette about facial NMES including its risks. Results showed that LOTP was generally high and that participants remained more likely to participate than not to, despite a decrease in LOTP after the detailed vignette. LOTP was significantly predicted by participants’ previous knowledge about electrical stimulation and their tendency not to worry about the sensations of pain, and it was inversely related to concerns for burns and loss of muscle control. Fear of pain was also inversely related to LOTP, but its effect was mediated by the other concerns. We conclude that willingness to receive facial NMES is generally high across individuals in the studied age range (18–45) and that it is particularly important to reassure participants about facial NMES safety regarding burns and loss of muscle control. The findings are relevant for scholars considering using facial NMES in the laboratory.},
