abstract: "When we observe a facial expression of emotion, we often mimic it. This\
  \ automatic mimicry reflects underlying sensorimotor simulation that supports accurate\
  \ emotion recognition. Why this is so is becoming more obvious: emotions are patterns\
  \ of expressive, behavioral, physiological, and subjective feeling responses. Activation\
  \ of one component can therefore automatically activate other components. When people\
  \ simulate a perceived facial expression, they partially activate the corresponding\
  \ emotional state in themselves, which provides a basis for inferring the underlying\
  \ emotion of the expresser. We integrate recent evidence in favor of a role for\
  \ sensorimotor simulation in emotion recognition. We then connect this account to\
  \ a domain-general understanding of how sensory information from multiple modalities\
  \ is integrated to generate perceptual predictions in the brain., People's recognition\
  \ and understanding of othersâ€™ facial expressions is compromised by experimental\
  \ (e.g., mechanical blocking) and clinical (e.g., facial paralysis and long-term\
  \ pacifier use) disruptions to sensorimotor processing in the face., Emotion perception\
  \ involves automatic activation of pre- and primary-motor and somatosensory cortices,\
  \ and the inhibition of activity in sensorimotor networks reduces performance on\
  \ subtle or challenging emotion recognition tasks., Sensorimotor simulation flexibly\
  \ supports not only conceptual processing of facial expression but also, through\
  \ cross-modal influences on visual processing, the building of a complete percept\
  \ of the expression., While automatic and presumably nonconscious, sensorimotor\
  \ simulation of facial expressions is modulated by the perceiver's social context\
  \ and motivational state."
