abstract: Cognitive reappraisal recruits prefrontal and parietal cortical areas. Because
  of the near exclusive usage in past research of visual stimuli to elicit emotions,
  it is unknown whether the same neural substrates underlie the reappraisal of emotions
  induced through other sensory modalities. Here, participants reappraised their emotions
  in order to increase or decrease their emotional response to angry prosody, or maintained
  their attention to it in a control condition. Neural activity was monitored with
  fMRI, and connectivity was investigated by using psychophysiological interaction
  analyses. A right-sided network encompassing the superior temporal gyrus, the superior
  temporal sulcus and the inferior frontal gyrus was found to underlie the processing
  of angry prosody. During reappraisal to increase emotional response, the left superior
  frontal gyrus showed increased activity and became functionally coupled to right
  auditory cortices. During reappraisal to decrease emotional response, a network
  that included the medial frontal gyrus and posterior parietal areas showed increased
  activation and greater functional connectivity with bilateral auditory regions.
  Activations pertaining to this network were more extended on the right side of the
  brain. Although directionality cannot be inferred from PPI analyses, the findings
  suggest a similar frontoparietal network for the reappraisal of visually and auditorily
  induced negative emotions.
