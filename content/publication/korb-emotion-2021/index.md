abstract: In a cross-cultural study, we investigated the link between explicit attitudes
  towards the hijab and implicit measures of cultural and religious bias during the
  recognition of emotions. Participants tested in Austria (N = 71) and in Turkey (N = 70)
  reported their attitude towards the hijab, and categorised in a mousetracker task
  happy and sad faces of women, shown with five levels of intensity, and framed either
  by a hijab or by an oval-shaped mask. The two samples did not differ in their explicit
  attitudes towards the hijab. However, negative attitude towards the hijab predicted
  greater sadness attribution to happy faces with the hijab in Austrian participants.
  Unrelated to their explicit attitudes, Turkish participants attributed more sadness
  to happy faces with than without the hijab. Results suggest that the sight of the
  hijab activated, in both Austrian and Turkish participants, implicit biases resulting
  in associations with sadness and negative emotions.
