abstract: Social rewards represent a strong driving force behind decisions and behaviors.
  Previous research suggests that the processing of a reward depends on the initial
  state of the individual. However, empirical research in humans on the influence
  of motivational states on reward processing is scant, especially for rewards of
  social nature. In the present study, we aimed at investigating how aversive and
  appetitive motivation affects the processing of social rewards, such as interpersonal
  touch. Participants (n = 102) were assigned to an appetitive (positive) or aversive
  (negative) motivational state condition (via modified versions of the Trier Social
  Stress Test) or to a control condition. After the state induction, their a) self-reports
  of wanting and liking, b) effort, and c) hedonic facial reactions during anticipation
  and consumption of interpersonal touch, were measured. Participants in the aversive
  group showed higher subjective wanting of interpersonal touch, but no changes in
  subjective liking, compared to the control group. The aversive group also showed
  stronger positive hedonic facial reactions during reward anticipation, reflecting
  stronger anticipatory pleasure. No significant effects were found for the appetitive
  group. The results indicate that, after having been exposed to an aversive experience,
  the motivation to obtain interpersonal touch, as well as the associated anticipatory
  pleasure, increase, without a corresponding change in liking during or after its
  consumption. The findings point to differential state-dependent effects on the processing
  of social rewards, possibly due to the action of different neurobiological systems
  regulating reward anticipation and consumption.
