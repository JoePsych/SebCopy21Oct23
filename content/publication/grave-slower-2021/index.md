abstract: Schizophrenia-spectrum disorders are characterized by deficits in social
  domains. Extant research has reported an impaired ability to perceive emotional
  faces in schizophrenia. Yet, it is unclear if these deficits occur already in the
  access to visual awareness. To investigate this question, 23 people with schizophrenia
  or schizoaffective disorder and 22 healthy controls performed a breaking continuous
  flash suppression task with fearful, happy, and neutral faces. Response times were
  analysed with generalized linear mixed models. People with schizophrenia-spectrum
  disorders were slower than controls in detecting faces, but did not show emotion-specific
  impairments. Moreover, happy faces were detected faster than neutral and fearful
  faces, across all participants. Although caution is needed when interpreting the
  main effect of group, our findings may suggest an elevated threshold for visual
  awareness in schizophrenia-spectrum disorders, but an intact implicit emotion perception.
  Our study provides a new insight into the mechanisms underlying emotion perception
  in schizophrenia-spectrum disorders.
