abstract: 'When forming basic social impressions, it is important to quickly and accurately
  classify facial expressions (including their spontaneity). Early studies on emotion
  perception, employing static pictures in the chimeric-face paradigm, demonstrated
  that expressions shown on the left hemi-face (LHF) were rated as more intense, compared
  to the right hemi-face (RHF). Interestingly, recent studies on emotion production,
  using high-speed video recordings, discovered an onset asymmetry (OAS) such that
  spontaneous expressions start earlier in the LHF, while posed expressions start
  in the RHF. Here, using highly controlled and dynamically developing video stimuli
  of avatar faces, we tested whether OASs in perceived faces influence the efficiency
  with which an expression is classified, as well as judgments of expression intensity,
  spontaneity, and trustworthiness. Videos of avatars making happy and angry expressions,
  with OASs of either 20 or 400 ms, were judged on several social dimensions by 68
  participants. The results highlight the importance of the LHF for emotion classifications
  and social judgments: Expressions with earlier LHF onsets were not only judged to
  be more spontaneous but were also detected more quickly and accurately (a difference
  that was most evident for angry expressions with a briefly presented OAS, but not
  for happy expressions). Generally, these findings underscore how adaptive social
  perception relies on subtle cues in the dynamics of emotional facial expressions.'
